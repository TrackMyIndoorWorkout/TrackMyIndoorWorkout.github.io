Please follow these steps if you don't see your equipment listed as compatible Bluetooth device:

0. In case your fitness equipment is a [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://spinning.com/spinner-chrono-power/) make sure the Bluetooth pairing is enabled as [demonstrated in this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w1IcI5twGY).
1. On the start screen press the menu button and then the gear icon to navigate to the settings.
1. Scroll to the bottom of the settings page.
1. Turn off "Device Filtering".
1. Go back to the start screen.
1. Please report the make, model, and the Bluetooth name of your fitness equipment so I can update the application to support it without settings fiddling.
1. Follow the [Quick Start Guide]({% post_url 2020-09-25-quick-start %}) from the 1st step (scanning for devices). Now you'll see many devices, you'd need to guess by the name which is your exercise equipment.
