0. Enable bluetooth pairing on your [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://spinning.com/spinner-chrono-power/) if you haven't done already following [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w1IcI5twGY).
1. On the start screen press the magnifying glass icon to start scanning for supported devices. The application looks for known bluetooth device names, in case of the [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://spinning.com/spinner-chrono-power/) that is "CHRONO" followed by a number. If your device has a non conventional name then the app won't list it. In that case please contact me.
2. Once the list of supported devices is shown (if you have multiple around you there are more), please pick the one you'd like to connect to and press the "Connect" button at the end of it's list item.
3. You'll be shuttled to the measurement screen and the app should automatically start the activity and display the current measurements. If that doesn't happen then you can first try to press the bluetooth icon in the header or if that doesn't help the play icon in the header.
4. If you don't see the play icon but only a stop icon that means the measurement is under way and the app should receive data. You should see readings and once you are pedaling the cadence, power readings won't be 0 any more, and your distance will advance. At the bottom you can see a visualization of how your GPS track points around the velodrome are advancing.
5. Once you are done with the activity press the stop icon. That will mark the activity finished.
6. You can prepare for the activity sync to Strava by pressing the strava icon button on any screen. This action will shuttle you to a browser window briefly so you can log in to Strava thus the recording app will gain authorization for uploading.
7. Press the list icon to navigate to the activities view. Past activities recorded are listed in descending time order. You can push the upload icon button to perform an activity upload to strava.
8. The download button enables you to obtain the compressed TCX activity file: you can use that to sync the activity to other preferred platforms than Strava.
9. WARNING: the activities reside only on the particular device, they are not backed up to any central server. Unless you sync the activities to Strava they could be lost if you uninstall the app, delete the app data, or if you delete the activity manually pressing the trash icon. Please keep that in mind and be careful.
