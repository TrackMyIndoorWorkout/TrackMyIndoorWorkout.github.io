      Your privacy is important to Track My Indoor Workout and it's creator:
      Csaba Consulting. This privacy policy provides information about
      the personal information the application may collect or pass along, and the
      ways in which the related services use that personal information.

  <h5>Personal information collection</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      <ul>
        <li>The application collects workout information as its main feature, so it can display workout details such as measurements on a time line or zone breakouts.</li>
        <li>Workout information may include: speed, power, calories, heart rate, elapsed time.</li>
        <li>The application may store entries of device usage if it encounters new devices so it can later quicker identify the sport of the device and other data. The stored information includes Bluetooth identifier, Bluetooth name, time, sport.</li>
        <li>The application <em>optionally</em> stores athlete weight when it is configured. It is used for standard spin-down (calibration) protocol or for calculating expensed calories based on heart rate, <em>only if the athlete chose to provide these values and wants to use this feature</em>.</li>
        <li>The application <em>optionally</em> stores athlete age, gender, VO2max when it is configured. It is used (and required) for calculating expensed calories based on heart rate, <em>only if the athlete chose to provide these values and wants to use this feature</em>.</li>
        <li>The application may record calorie and power tunes to be able to provide the calorie and power tune feature benefiting the user. This is optional and requires explicit user action.</li>
        <li>The application may record debug data for debug purposes if the user explicitly opts-in in the Expert Preferences section. Debug log may contain crash call stacks, scanned device information, data packets received from other devices. The debug log is human readable and it can only leave the device if the user gives UI commands to export the contents. Even after the export it is up to the user to transfer the zipped log files to any destination.</li>
      </ul>

  <h5>Securing your data</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The application uses standard methods and APIs to connect to and send data to Strava and other fitness portals. These days all communications use encrypted communication channels (HTTPS, SSL, TLS). The app uses native functions for downloading files. The data travels over encrypted channels but it is not encrypted by itself (the portals would not accept an encrypted file). The user have the option to remove any information desired any time:
      <ul>
        <li>Any workout can be deleted from the activities screen by clicking on the thrashcan icon</li>
        <li>Any device usage entry can be deleted from the device usage screen
        (accessible from the activities screen menu) by clicking on the thrashcan icon</li>
        <li>Any power tune can be deleted from the power tunes screen
        (accessible from the activities screen menu) by clicking on the thrashcan icon</li>
        <li>Any calorie tune can be deleted from the calorie tunes screen
        (accessible from the activities screen menu) by clicking on the thrashcan icon</li>
        <li>Athlete personal data (weight, age, gender, VO2max) can be changed or cleared in the settings any time. That may disable some capabilites though: spin-down will still function but the heart rate based calorie feature won't</li>
        <li>All of the debug logs can be deleted with the related button click in the Expert Preferences</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class="section">
  <h5>Cross-border data transfers</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The application doesn't transmit any data without <em>explicit user action</em> whatsoever. The three use-cases are:
      <ol>
        <li>Uploading activity to Strava or other ftiness portals</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>Downloading activity as a file (FIT, TCX, migration CSV, or supported formats)</li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>Exporting recorded debug logs</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="col s12">
      When information travels from the mobile app to fitness portals or data storage it is communicated through secure channels, but inherently the data is not encrypted. In case of data exports it is up to the user how data data is transferred later, this is out of the jurisdiction of the application.

  <h5>Terms of Service</h5>

  <div class="row">
    <div class="col s12">
      The creator is not responsible for any damage or loss caused by the app. The app doesn't have any guarantee about connecting to the bike or treadmill, recording, and uploading workouts. The Android ecosystem can be complex, and even simple things like not turning off battery optimization for the app or if it is in the background could cause problems. The bluetooth eco-system can be problematic as well.
