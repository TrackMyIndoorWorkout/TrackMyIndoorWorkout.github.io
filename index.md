Virtual Velodrome Rider is an application for [Precor Spinning Power Chrono](https://www.precor.com/en-us/commercial/cardio/indoor-cycling/spinner-chrono-power) bike owners to allow recording of virtual rides with GPS route like you'd circling laps in the [Jerry Baker Memorial Velodrome](https://velodrome.org/) in [Redmond, Washington](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Jerry+Baker+Memorial+Velodrome/@47.6659161,-122.1125076,96m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x7d3c1ebef878f4c!8m2!3d47.665894!4d-122.1126097). The [Wahoo application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wahoofitness.fitness) is unofficially capable of recording workouts but it is not picking up the power meter and the cadence readings. The Virtual Velodrome Rider has Strava integration and will also offer TCX file download.
