Please follow these steps if you don't see your equipment listed as compatible Bluetooth device:

0. In case your fitness equipment is a [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://spinning.com/spinner-chrono-power/) make sure the Bluetooth pairing is enabled as [demonstrated in this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w1IcI5twGY).
1. Also be sure that bluetooth permissions are not revoked from the Track My Indoor Workout application in your handheld device's settings.
1. On the start screen press the menu button and then the funnel icon button.
1. On the upcoming dialog select "No" for filtering of the Bluetooth equipment. This should show all equipment so you can pick any connectable Bluetooth Low Energy device. This filtering behavior can also be configured on the preferences screen.
1. Please report the make, model, and the Bluetooth name of your fitness equipment so I can update the application to support it without settings fiddling.
1. Follow the [Quick Start Guide]({% post_url 2020-09-25-quick-start %}) from the 1st step (scanning for devices). Now you'll see many devices, you'd need to guess by the name which is your exercise equipment.
