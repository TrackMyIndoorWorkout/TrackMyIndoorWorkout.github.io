Please follow these steps if you don't see your device listed as compatible Bluetooth device:

0. Make sure you enabled bluetooth pairing on your [Precor Spinner® Chrono™ Power](https://spinning.com/spinner-chrono-power/) following [this Youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8w1IcI5twGY).
1. On the start screen press the gear icon to navigate to the settings.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the settings page.
3. Turn of "Device Filtering".
4. Go back to the start screen.
5. Follow the [Quick Start Guide]({% post_url 2020-09-25-quick-start %}) from the 1st step (scanning for devices). Now you'll see many devices, you'd need to guess by the name which is your exercise equipment.
