Q: The graphs are too tall on the workout measurement screen, can I change that?

A: There's an undocumented feature: long press the graph you wish the change the height of. The app will rotate between 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 screen height versions. Your choice should be preserved between application runs similarly as the status of which graphs is visible or not.
